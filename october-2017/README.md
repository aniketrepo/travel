| This is the story of my solo motorcycle ride to Dhanaulti, Uttarakhand in India, during October, 2017. Best part of this journey was, that i tracked 627 kilometers in 18 hours only, in a single day|

---

##  4:05 AM Ghaziabad
*	For last few days, I was feeling the intense pulls to ride again. My restless soul is eager to gain some peace from a ride
*	I read a mesmerizing story [Leh to Kanyakumari in 61 Hours by Balaji](https://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/36273-leh-kanyakumari-61-hours.html) and challenged myself to ride maximum in a single day
*	Worried of uncertainties, which I might face during the todays long ride. i said nothing to my wife about my todays rigorous plan
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, without any compromise with my riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through good roads of Ghaziabad
* 	Arrived at NH-58, the state highway, which connects Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India
*	Owing to major festival (Diwali) next week traffic is comparatively low from usual

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	State of solace arrives; internal dialogue between mind and heart is started to culminate
*	Feeling powerful again; feeling unattached to any man made classification, I am just a nomadic rider now
*	All myriad thoughts about reactions, judgments, hates and regrets are passing through my head
*	Adios all my fears, adios all my worries, I am living in the moment! 
*	Not able to see any  long distance rider, which I usually encounter on this route, I throttled to ~70 kmps

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Bypassed Meerut, took the new toll way to Haridwar, riding towards Modipuram
*	This is the perfect road to experience the real cruising speed of an Enfield  

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Bypassing the famous city of Uttar Pradesh, India. Famous for its sugar and jaggery 
*	Muzzarnagar is famous for its sugar cane farming. Greenery around is so peaceful in morning time

*	And the first encounter with notorious fog!
*	Trying to stay behind a truck but it’s risky for a motorcycle. When not able to move completely, i stopped and took some pictures of infamous north Indian fog

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Roorkee has a large army base with headquarters for 'Bengal Engineer Group' (BEG), also known as Bengal Sappers
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school kids and service class has started their day
*	I am bypassing traffic and trying to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon took the left turn to the Dehradun road. No sign of any clear road, frequent gear change is ruining my ride

##  7:20 AM Bhagwanpur
*	Usual traffic and bad roads, giving eerie feelings. No one is interested in the joy of a man
*	Relying on honking and overtakes, slowly steering through this small town

##  7:40 AM Chhutmalpur
*	A small town surrounded by several villages, makes it a minor hub of semi urban life
*	Passing through the sugarcane fields, at a limited speed of ~50
*	India is the second largest producer of sugarcane in World. This northern part of UP is known as a bowl of sugar
*	Farmers of this reason are famous for the highest sugarcane production 

##  8:15 AM Mohand
*	And the hills start, I took a pause, gulped some nuts and started my action camera
*	Some local riders are curious about my outlook trying to catch up with my speed
*	Road is broken at several places but still the peace of driving in hills is worth, to ignore some holes
*	Arrived at **Daat Kali tunnel** and famous temple. As usual a jam is in my sight. I ignored the rules and try to skip some traffic by riding wrong side
*	I was able to leave the tunnel behind comparatively quick and throttled towards Dehradun

##  9:30 AM Dehradun
*	Arrived in capital of Uttarakhand, it’s a typical city, with traffic and encroachment
*	From my earlier visits to this famous hills city, I see a big difference of flyovers and red light based traffic governance
*	I am heading towards Mussoorie and finding that the road to Mussoorie is more commercialized now
*	Exactly before the hill town, took a pause of few minutes

##  10:30 AM Mussoorie
*	Mussoorie seems so busy now, I thought of my earlier visits to this beautiful city and realized the changes
*	Road to Dhanaulti is exactly before the government inter collage, on your right hand. I missed it and took a U turn after enquiring from locals
*	Arrived on road to Dhanaulti, its steep and narrow now; which means excitement
*	I found that road is under construction and with some minor halts here and there, i was peacefully riding uphill 
*	The more I drove, the more peaceful and lonely it became. Finally i halted at a turn to rest and captured some beautiful moments

##  12:00 PM Dhanaulti
*	Arrived in this beautiful village. It is a small heaven, far better than highly commercialized Mussoorie
*	On my right is the famous Dhanaulti Eco Park, stopped for some photos there. Some more riders also resting here
*	The usual noodle (maggi) & tea stalls everywhere on the roadsides. Restarted again for my next stop Kanatal which is the next village

##  1:30 PM Chamba
*	Arrived in Chamba, the long drive has left me hungry
* 	My eyes are in search of an eatery, which can serve me enough to survive another six hours
* 	On the main square of town, found a Janta hotel, typical dhaba style
* 	Parked my stallion at the front, the staff is curious. I jumped on a vacant bench and ordered the lentils (mix daal) and bread (roti)
* 	Scrounged good enough but limited to avoid any fatigue. Chamba is also the nearest town of famous Tehri Dam, which is only few kilometers away from here
*	After few minutes of rest, i restarted again towards Rishikesh

##  3:00 PM Nagni
*	At a small road side village named Nagni, which also has a petrol pump, took bath in small stream of river, which is flowing adjacent to the road
*	Filled my belly and my water bottle with rich mineral water, with a thankful glance at my stallion, i gave the famous mild half kick to it
*	Thump of Enfield is aloud in hills, the famous dug dug sound makes people curious, school kids waving and receiving the joy back

##  4:15 PM Narendra Nagar
*	Arrived in Narendra Nagar, thinking to stop here, but finally throttled towards Rishikesh
*	My body is lazy now, i can feel that my brain is tired from this 12 hours continuous drive
*	Food and bath has also affected my brain activity. Its performing slow now
*	At a turn my turning calculations went wrong and motorcycles front tire skid into the roadside small ditch 
*	Luckily my riding gears helped me to skip any big injury except a minor sprain in my left wrist
*	A gentleman helped me to drag my motorcycle and after few minutes of inspection, I climbed my motorcycle again
*	After riding few minutes, i started feeling that my wrist is in acute pain while holding the clutch
*	Holding the clutch is necessary while driving down in hills. Pain was increasing every moment 
*	I took a pause to give some relax to my hand. I learned the lesson to **Always carry the basic medicines during the rides**

##  5:30 PM Rishikesh
*	Arrived in Rishikesh, and my wrist is giving me a hell of a pain. Time for me to switch on my endurance mode
*	Stopped near a small fruit juice shack, gulped a big glass of sweet lime juice while chatting this laborious vendor
*	Within 10 minutes of meeting, he shared about the hardships of his life. How he is struggling to pay off his loans
*	After buying a pain spray and applying on my aching wrist, i looked in sky and visualize myself crossing Haridwar before sunset
*	Wrist is still the same, but my will is more stronger than the pain, Here the bravo rides again

##  6:20 PM Haridwar
*	Arrived in Haridwar, there is no sign of reduction in wrist pain. It’s hurting like hell while i press the clutch
*	I am constant riding on ~70, Its not excitement now, its craving to reach home and kill this pain
*	It’s getting dark, I have switched on my headlights

##  7:30 PM Roorkee
*	Arrived in Roorkee, feeling like a big mistake to ride with wrist pain
*	Laughed on myself and realize that madness is necessary to live life. Real life is always beyond madness
*	At least i have a story of courage for myself!
*	My extra lights are not working, sounds like a fault with switch, it made me to open my helmet visor, to see clearly
*	Trying to mix with local traffic, to avoid facing to any potholes, on this newly constructed highway
*	Wrist is almost dead by this time. Giving me every kind of feelings to accept that I am a big fool!!
*	Yes, i am a fool but i will be wise if i avoid the same mistake again!

##  8:20 PM Muzaffarnagar
*	Arrived in Muzaffarnagar, Reduction in local traffic but lack of road lights is making difficult
*	Lesson learnt that i will install two sets of extra lights, except the head light. Lights are necessary to stay more vigilant in dark
*	Paused at the toll tax plaza, emptied my bladder and called home to surprise that i am riding back!
*	Mild breeze of air is giving a soothing feeling but my hand is like hell and pain spray is useless now

##  9:20 PM Meerut
*	Arrived in Meerut, limited traffic on road. I am riding at the same ~70. There are road lights at some places, which makes it easy
*	My hand is like hell. Every moment its becoming hard. With unbearable pain of pulling the clutch, i gave a final push towards the best place called Home!

##  10:10 PM Modinagar
*	Passing the small roadside town with a good speed with mixed feelings of excitement and pain
*	Traffic lights are reminding me the old classical Hindi songs where the protagonist is restlessly wandering on roads in nights
*	With heart full of gratitude to the great riding spirits, I am riding towards my home!

##  10:30 PM Ghaziabad
*	Arrived at home. Ate beans and rice, before jumping on bed and lay like dead!
*	I finished my journey! there are going to be more such stories in future, but every story is going to make me a better Man!
