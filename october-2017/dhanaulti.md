##  4:05 AM Ghaziabad
*	For last few days, i was feeling the intense pulls to ride again. My restless soul is eager to gain some peace from a ride
*	I read a mesmerizing story [Leh to Kanyakumari in 61 Hours by Balaji](https://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/36273-leh-kanyakumari-61-hours.html) and challanged myself to ride maximum in a single day
*	Worried of uncertainities, which i might face duing the todays long ride. i said nothing to my wife about my todays rigorous plan
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, without any compromise with my riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through good roads of Ghaziabad
* 	Arrived at NH-58, the state highway, which connects Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India
*	Owing to major festival (Diwali) next week traffic is comparatively low from usual

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	State of solace arrives; internal dialogue between mind and heart is started to culminate
*	Feeling powerfull again; feeling unattached to any man made classification, i am just a nomadic rider now
*	All myraid thoughts about reactions, judgements, hates and regrets are passing through my head
*	Adios all my fears, adios all my worries, i am living in the mooment! 
*	Not able to see any rider, which i usually encounter on this route, i throttled to ~70 kmps

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Bypassed Meerut, took the new toll way to Haridwar, riding towards Modipuram
*	This is the road to see the real cruising speed of an Enfield  

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Bypassing the famous city of Uttar Pradesh, India. Famous for its sugar and jaggery 
*	Muzzarnagar is famous for its sugar cane farming. Greenery around is so peacefull in morning time.
*	And the first encounter with notorious fog!
*	Trying to stay behind a truck but its risky again for a motercycle. Finally when not able to move, i stopped and took some pictures of infamous north India fog

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Roorkee has a large army base with headquarters for 'Bengal Engineer Group' (BEG), also known as Bengal Sappers
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school kids and service class has started their day
*	I am bypassing traffic and trying to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon took the left turn to the Dehradun road. No sign of any clear road, frequent gear change is ruining my ride

##  7:20 AM Bhagwanpur
*	Usual traffic and bad roads, giving errie feelings. No one is interested in the joy of a man
*	Relying on honkings and overtakes, slowly steering through this small town

##  7:40 AM Chhutmalpur

##  8:15 AM Mohand
*	And the hills start, i took a pause, gulped some nuts and started my action camera

##  1:30 PM Chamba
*	Arrived in Chamba, the long drive has left me hungry
* 	My eyes are in search of an eatory, which can serve me enough to survive another six hours
* 	On the main square of town, found a Janta hotel, typical dhaba style
* 	Parked my stallion at the front, the staff is curious. I jumped on a vacant bench and ordered the lentils (mix daal) and bread (roti)
* 	Scrounged good enough but limited to avoid any fatigue

##  2:30 PM Fakot

##  3:30 PM Nagni
*	At a small road side village named Nagni, which also has a petrol pump, took bath in small stream of river, which is flowing adjacent to the road
*	Filled my belly and my water bottle with mineral rich water, with a thankfull glance on my stallion, i gave the famous mild half kick to it
*	Tmump of Enfield is aloud on peacefull hills, the famous dug dug makes people curious, school kids waving and recieving the joy back
