##  4:05 AM Ghaziabad
*	For last few days, i was feeling the intense pulls to ride again. My restless soul is eager to gain some peace from todays long ride 
*	I read a mesmerizing story [Leh to Kanyakumari in 61 Hours by Balaji](https://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/36273-leh-kanyakumari-61-hours.html) and challanged myself to ride maximum in a single day
*	I am worried, of uncertainities , which i might face duing the todays long ride. i said nothing to my wife about my todays plan
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, without any compromise with my riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through good roads of Ghaziabad, India
* 	Arrived at NH-58, the state highway, which connects Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India
*	Owing to Major festival next wee, named Diwali, traffic is comparatively low from usual

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	Another solo rider, on a Bajaj Pulsar has just passed me, waving me in confidence
*	I hooked to his tail with my all senses opened to judge, the slightest of movement around my motorcycle
* 	We carefully steered through the traffic around us, and attracted the eyes of many 
* 	We crossed Modinagar and arrived at Meerut bypass, where i took the lead, and finally throttled my best
*	Finally i was in bullet attitude, but with all senses opened to avoid any mistake and started cutting the traffic
*	Solo riding makes you more responsible, you have to avoid every small negligence, which eventually helps in avoiding any disaster

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Arrived in Meerut but still no sign of sunlight, i am feeling confident to reach my destination within stipulated time
*	At my maximum cruising speed of 80 KMPS, which is only possible in such minimal traffic, in India
*	Heading towards Muzaffarnagar, on clear roads. Another large biker group, at a very coordinated and controlled pace, mostly Haryana number plates
*	I waved the group and accelerated, able to see the sunlight now

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	This new highway is the face of new emerging India. It gives me immense proud to born in such a great period of transformation 
*	People in my generation, who are experiencing this change, will have a story to tell to new generations
*	India's highest sugarcane growing fields are all around me. Greenery is the major sign of this region
*	Slowly the highway came to end, entering the single side road, heading towards Roorkee city

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering Institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school busses are ferrying kids and staffs. I can see uniform clad elegant female Army doctors, heading for their work
*	I am getting first sign of Uttarakhand Police. I am easily traversing through roads and happy to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon back to the nice highway again. Throttle is to my maximum cruising speed, heading for the city of Gods

##  8:00 AM Dehradun
*	Arrived on time, Hill life is waiting for me, throttled again to max, towards Rishikesh
*	While crossing the Rajaji National Part, I started feeling the hill vibes
*	A small pee stop and after collecting my energies, I climbed again on my 9 years old companion
*	Unstopped until I arrived on a train crossing, felt good to break all my previous records of covering the maximum distance
*	A curious lad is questioned by me, he delightedly guided me towards the road to Narendra Nagar
