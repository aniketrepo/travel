##  4:05 AM Ghaziabad
*	For last few days, i was feeling the intense pulls to ride again. My restless soul is eager to gain some peace from todays long ride 
*	I read a mesmerizing story [Leh to Kanyakumari in 61 Hours by Balaji](https://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/36273-leh-kanyakumari-61-hours.html) and challanged myself to ride maximum in a single day
*	I am worried, of uncertainities , which i might face duing the todays long ride. i said nothing to my wife about my todays plan
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, without any compromise with my riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through good roads of Ghaziabad, India
* 	Arrived at NH-58, the state highway, which connects Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India
*	Owing to Major festival next wee, named Diwali, traffic is comparatively low from usual

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	Another solo rider, on a Bajaj Pulsar has just passed me, waving me in confidence
*	I hooked to his tail with my all senses opened to judge, the slightest of movement around my motorcycle
* 	We carefully steered through the traffic around us, and attracted the eyes of many 
* 	We crossed Modinagar and arrived at Meerut bypass, where i took the lead, and finally throttled my best
*	Finally i was in bullet attitude, but with all senses opened to avoid any mistake and started cutting the traffic
*	Solo riding makes you more responsible, you have to avoid every small negligence, which eventually helps in avoiding any disaster

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Arrived in Meerut but still no sign of sunlight, i am feeling confident to reach my destination within stipulated time
*	At my maximum cruising speed of 80 KMPS, which is only possible in such minimal traffic, in India
*	Heading towards Muzaffarnagar, on clear roads. Another large biker group, at a very coordinated and controlled pace, mostly Haryana number plates
*	I waved the group and accelerated, able to see the sunlight now

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	This new highway is the face of new emerging India. It gives me immense proud to born in such a great period of transformation 
*	People in my generation, who are experiencing this change, will have a story to tell to new generations
*	India's highest sugarcane growing fields are all around me. Greenery is the major sign of this region
*	Slowly the highway came to end, entering the single side road, heading towards Roorkee city

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering Institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school busses are ferrying kids and staffs. I can see uniform clad elegant female Army doctors, heading for their work
*	I am getting first sign of Uttarakhand Police. I am easily traversing through roads and happy to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon back to the nice highway again. Throttle is to my maximum cruising speed, heading for the city of Gods

##  8:00 AM Dehradun
*	Arrived on time, Hill life is waiting for me, throttled again to max, towards Rishikesh
*	While crossing the Rajaji National Part, I started feeling the hill vibes
*	A small pee stop and after collecting my energies, I climbed again on my 9 years old companion
*	Unstopped until I arrived on a train crossing, felt good to break all my previous records of covering the maximum distance
*	A curious lad is questioned by me, he delightedly guided me towards the road to Narendra Nagar

##  8:45 AM Rishikesh
*	Arrived at spiritual capital of India, but took a left turn to skip its beautiful ashrams and Ganga ghats
*	Hill climb is started, steep turns quickly alerted my throttle hungry mind to slow down
*	No sign of traffic, I am mostly alone on these curvy roads. The best part of journey is around me now ... Hills!

##  10:00 AM Narendra Nagar
*	Still untouched with the urbanization, Narendra Nagar still gives the nostalgic feelings of classical towns
*	After crossing the town, I stopped at a small shack, devoured delicious aloo parathas and chat with localities
*	Next city is Chamba, which is just an hour away from here
*	I refit myself to one last push to my destination called Tehri Dam
*	I am experiencing road sign of land sliding prone areas more often and hills have become whiter

##  11:00 AM Chamba
*	A small town, providing further connects to Tehri and Mussoorie 
*	Town shows no sign of travelers, only local public curiously starring and trying to judge me
*	After respectfully enquiring a police man, I chose the correct road to Tehri Dam
*	Road had become narrow and poor, on my left I have started experiencing the water flow
*	This water flow got bigger and bigger as I got closer to Dam, and finally the WoW factor arrived

##  11:45 AM Tehri Dam
*	Finally arrived at Tehri Dam, ride to this destination took 7.45 hours. Not bad! Feeling really proud!
*	Access to Dam is restricted by Central Industrial Security Force, I rode to a high point, where i can see the dam
*	Found a lonely place at one beautiful corner of road, where I can see the dam and be in peace
*	Parked my stallion, removed all my gears, sit on a bench and thanks to God, for rewarding me this healthy journey
*	Took some of beautiful pictures, from my phone. Experienced the flora and fauna of region while peacefully sitting there
*	Spent around 1 hour there, ate some dry fruits and biscuits, and finally refit myself for the 85 kilometers journey back to Rishikesh

##  12:45 PM Tehri Dam, Heading back
*	Same route but scoarching sun is eating more energy this time, I am now able to see some of riders, heading towards dam
*	At a small road side village named Nagni, I decided to take a bath in small stream of river
*	Some village kids were playing there, initially scarred with my looks, but soon became comfortable with me
*	Soon the place where I parked my motorcycle, became a picnic spot for a foreigner family
*	Kids from this family, got curious about me and spent few minutes, looking at my travel gears 
*	Finally i bid adieu to all kids and headed towards Rishikesh

##  4:00 PM Rishikesh
*	After experiencing several hill towns, I realized Rishikesh is nowhere close to a real hill town
*	Checked in at my favorite Iskon temple guest house (Madhuban Ashram). Unpacked my gears, took bath and get some rest
*	At around 6 o'clock, I started towards Parmarth Ashram for evening Aarti
*	Bought some Geeta press books from famous Geeta ashram, before arriving at Parmarth ashram
*	Aarti is started, and sitting in front of Ganga and thinking of my whole journey
*	Called my home and some of my friends, ate delicious street food named Chole Kulche and finally at 7:30, headed back to guest house
*	While strolling at the banks of Ganga, I could feel the cool breeze of air, so rejuvenating. Finally arrived at the guest house
*	A good night call to my wife at 8:30 before I plan to retire for the day
*	While trying to sleep, I was thinking of all people, whom I met during my journey and how they live peacefully in this natural abode
*	I finally forced my eyes to shut and to tried to sleep. Don't remember when did i slept while thinking about tomorrows long ride to home
