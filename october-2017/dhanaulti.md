##  4:05 AM Ghaziabad
*	For last few days, i was feeling the intense pulls to ride again. My restless soul is eager to gain some peace from a ride
*	I read a mesmerizing story [Leh to Kanyakumari in 61 Hours by Balaji](https://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/36273-leh-kanyakumari-61-hours.html) and challanged myself to ride maximum in a single day
*	Worried of uncertainities, which i might face duing the todays long ride. i said nothing to my wife about my todays rigorous plan
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, without any compromise with my riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through good roads of Ghaziabad
* 	Arrived at NH-58, the state highway, which connects Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India
*	Owing to major festival (Diwali) next week traffic is comparatively low from usual

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	State of solace arrives; internal dialogue between mind and heart is started to culminate
*	Feeling powerfull again; feeling unattached to any man made classification, i am just a nomadic rider now
*	All myraid thoughts about reactions, judgements, hates and regrets are passing through my head
*	Adios all my fears, adios all my worries, i am living in the mooment! 
*	Not able to see any rider, which i usually encounter on this route, i throttled to ~70 kmps

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Bypassed Meerut, took the new toll way to Haridwar, riding towards Modipuram
*	This is the road to see the real cruising speed of an Enfield  

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Bypassing the famous city of Uttar Pradesh, India. Famous for its sugar and jaggery 
*	Muzzarnagar is famous for its sugar cane farming. Greenery around is so peacefull in morning time.

*	And the first encounter with notorious fog!
*	Trying to stay behind a truck but its risky again for a motercycle. Finally when not able to move, i stopped and took some pictures of infamous north Indian fog

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Roorkee has a large army base with headquarters for 'Bengal Engineer Group' (BEG), also known as Bengal Sappers
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school kids and service class has started their day
*	I am bypassing traffic and trying to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon took the left turn to the Dehradun road. No sign of any clear road, frequent gear change is ruining my ride

##  7:20 AM Bhagwanpur
*	Usual traffic and bad roads, giving errie feelings. No one is interested in the joy of a man
*	Relying on honkings and overtakes, slowly steering through this small town

##  7:40 AM Chhutmalpur
*	A small town surrounded by several villages, makes it a minor hub of semi urban life
*	Passing through the sugarcane fields, at a limited speed of ~50
*	India is the second largest producor of sugarcane in World. This northern part of UP is known as a bowl of sugar
*	Farmers of this reason are famous for the higest sugarcane production 

##  8:15 AM Mohand
*	And the hills start, i took a pause, gulped some nuts and started my action camera
*	Some local riders are curious about my outlook trying to catch up with my speed
*	Road is broken at several places but still the peace of driving in hills is worth, to ignore some holes
*	Arrived at **Daat Kali tunnel** and famous temple. As usual a jam is in my sight. I ignored the rules and try to skip some traffic by riding wrong side
*	I was able to leave the tunnel behind comparitively quick and throttled towards Dehradun

##  10:30 AM Mussoorie
*	Mussoorie seems so busy now, i thought of my earlier visits to this beautifull city and realized the changes
*	Road to Dhanaulti is exactly before the government inter collage, on your right hand. I missed it and took a U turn after enquiring from locals
*	Arrived on road to Dhanaulti, its steep and narrow now; which means excitement
*	I found that road is under construction and with some minor halts here and there, i was peacefully riding uphill 
*	The more i drove, the more peaceful and lonely it became. Finally i halted at a turn to rest for few minutes and took captured some images
