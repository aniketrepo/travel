---

##  Ghaziabad
*	This time Universe has chosen Spiti valley for me
*	It 5 o'clock and the beautiful morning reminds me of famous quote "You see what you carry in your heart"

*	Keeping the throttle below 70, owing to motorcycle's engine break in limitation
*	Taking more pauses to avoid stressing the new engine, clicking pictures here and there

*	By the time i arrived in Kufri, it is raining cats of dogs and my free riding has turned into hide and seek
*	Thinking about what if i miss my todays plan to reach Narkanda
*	Its dark and i am completely drenched and shivering. My hands are numb and turned wrinkly
*	After almost 3 hours of complete wetness, i reached outskirts of Narkanda. Billeted into a lodge at around 7 PM

##  Narkanda
*	Next morning its still raining and no sign of sun. Stuck in hotel and thinking about how farthest i can go today. Plan is to reach Nako
*	Finally i left hotel at around 11 AM and spent entire day riding at slow speed in intermittent rains

##	Spillow (Khab and Leo)
*	Arrived at Spillow by 7 PM. My planned destination Nako is one hour away from here
*	There is a risky stone shooting zone immediately after Spillow, locals suggested to pass it during the day time
*	Decided to stay at Spillow after talking to a gentleman, who later became a good friend of mine
*	During the dinner had talks co-travelers. Received lot of respect after they recognized that i am a solo traveler
*	Post the dinner the hotel owner offered me a local wine called Chulli, made of apricots
*	Enjoyed every sip of Chulli with lots of loud laughs with restaurant staff before going to sleep
*	Its 7 o'clock and i am back on road. Passed the risky shooting zone behind a military cavalcade 
*	Within 1 hour, arrived at Khab-Sangam, which is the confluence of Satluj and Spiti rivers
*	A mettle bridge helps cross the rivers and ride into cliff-hanging narrow road

*	Tabo is famous for its monestry and a heliport. I clicked no pictures as its forbidden in Tabo monestry
*	Took pause at Tabo bridge and ate fresh apples from nearby orchard after washing them in the water stream

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20190930_144851.jpg)

*	Immediately after passing the Tabo, come this long stretch, passing through the beautiful mountains
*	Stopped again and while sitting on the road in state of complete thoughtlessness, realized about how small is my existence in front of the nature

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191001_121315.jpg)

*	Its sunny and sky is so clear which a city dweller like me will rarely experience

*	Spend some time there talking to local people. Its getting dark so started riding towards Kaza
*	Arrived near Kaza and stopped at this beautiful message made of waste plastic bottles, to highlight the significance of not using single use plastic

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191001_160240.jpg)

*	Back to the home stay and now time to relax and enjoy the small town delicacies and culture
*	Checked with locals about the Kaza-Manali route, which is one of the most difficult in entire region
*	Locals suggested to start as early as possible, Its only 200 kilometers but its one the offroad heaven
*	Road from Kaza to Manali is open only June to October. It can be closed anytime now because its already October
*	Not expecting anyone to assist me in during tomorrows ride, so i am better prepared to pass it alone
*	Bought a pair of long gum boots, helpful to cross the water streams. Also scrounged some bread and butter for tomorrows breakfast
*	Went to bed at around 10 PM so that next days ride can be started early 

##	Kaza to Manali (Rangrik, Losar, Kunzum, Batal, Chota Dara and Rohtang)
*	Its 7 o'clock in the morning and today i will ride through worlds most treacherous and isolated region
*	Almost 70% of my luggage is tools, spares and everything that is required to take me out of any hell
*	Worn all my safety gears: polyester thermals, level 2 riding jacket and pant, kidney belt, hydration pack, warm gloves, balaclava and helmet
*	Today is the day to test my physical and mental efficiency. With a larger then life attitude, i said to myself "What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"    

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191011_190433.jpg)

*	Realizing the significance of a fine morning around me, while heading towards Losar from Rangrik

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_095552.jpg)

*	Before Losar clicked picture of stones with message "Om Mani Padme Hum". Entire Spiti and Laddakh region is full of such engraved stones

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_115712-01.jpeg)

*	Losar has a police check post, which requires verification before heading further towards Manali
*	After riding for around 2 hours from Losar, reached at famous Kunzum pass and temple
*	One of the highest pass famous for its altitude and difficult surroundings, spend sometime there and headed towards Batal 

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_125348.jpg)

*	Batal is nothing but few makeshift huts, which are shops run by famous gaddi people of this region
*	Gaddi people run these shops for around 4 months a year and they are the only source of survival on this route

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_131348.jpg)

*	Didn't stopped at Batal and rather decided to reach Manali as soon as possible
*	There is no sign of tarmac on this route, pebbles everywhere, which wont let you go beyond second or third gear
*	From Batal starts the water crossings, which are very dangerous when you alone, as there is no one if you fall
*	At one crossing, my tyre stuck into pebbles but came out after a careful utilization of physical strength along with the power of motorcycle

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_135621.jpg)

*	Arrived at Chota Dara, which has some buildings but found no one there

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_141201.jpg)

*	Reached Chatru at around 4 PM, which has some makeshift arrangements in tents for food and stay
*	Took my lunch there and met some other fellow foreign origin riders, heading towards Kaza
*	Also met a famous you tuber, later i was surprised to find that he published me in his video

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_152246.jpg)

*	The dhaba owner discouraged me to go further. I laughed and offered him a ride to Kullu
*	Arrived at Gramphu where this route merges into Manali-Leh highway. Feel relaxed after realizing that the difficult stretch is over
*	The next stop is Rohtang Pass after a ride for almost an hour, which is another high altitude pass

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_164409-01.jpeg)

*	It was very cold at Rohtang, was barely able to click a picture. Its getting dark and i plan to pass Manali today

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/raw/master/september-2019/images/IMG_20191002_193113.jpg)

*	Passed Rohtang and its notorious fog which is really dangerous, when its dark and you on motorcycle
*	Reached Manali by 8 PM, took a pause at a small shop and devoured noodles, which i generally avoid
*	I am thinking about riding as much as i can so that tomorrows ride can be shorter
*	After riding for almost 2 hours, arrived at the outskirts of Kullu and found a decent hotel
*	Realized that my entire ride today was around 14 hours and i have passed worlds most treacherous route
*	With a peaceful heart, i went into a small session of meditation before a good night sleep

*	Some of my favorite pictures from this ride
