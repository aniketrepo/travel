*	Arrived at Spillow by 7 PM. My planned destination Nako is one hour away from here

*	During the dinner had talks co-travelers. Received lot of respect after they recognized that i am a solo traveler
*	Post the dinner the hotel owner offered me a local wine called Chulli, made of apricots
*	Enjoyed every sip of Chulli with lots of loud laughs with restaurant staff before going to sleep
*	Its 7 o'clock and i am back on road. Passed the risky shooting zone behind a military cavalcade 
*	Within 1 hour, arrived at Khab-Sangam, which is confluence of Satluj and Spiti rivers
