## **Pieces of wisdom**
* Always pack before sleeping
* Carry spare keys of your motorcycle
* From Srinagar wear your warm liners
* No puncture repair in Leh on Sunday
* Try to avoid a pillion on this ride
* Carry only the most essential items
* Always give way to climbing vehicles 
* Control your ego while riding in groups
* Carry ample cash, while riding in hills
* Tighten your spare fuel can with carrier
* Avoid accelerating with half clutch for long
* Take small pauses every 1-2 hours to cool down
* Honk on every turn and never drive in wrong lane
* Never skip any checkpoint, always register with them
* Fog light at fronts and reflecting tapes at the back
* Stay friendly with everyone, you encounter while riding
* In high altitude regions, avoid staying long or sleeping
* Remember the cold starting your motorcycle every morning 
* Water and food are the key to health, drink and eat wisely
* Switch off your lights to let climbing vehicles see clearly
* Prepaid connections don't work in J&K. Best is BSNL postpaid
* Fill up your tanks every night, to avoid any delay in morning
* Do not ride in the outer most lane, its where the animal roams
* Keep glucose biscuits and ORS liquid at easily accessible place
* Early start is best to avoid any traffic. Avoid riding late hours
* Avoid making pre-bookings; planning doesnâ€™t works mostly on this trip
* In case of any medical emergency, contact the local military camps
* Avoid any bravery while crossing the water streams (nala), take help
* Avoid starting your motorcycle while crossing the water streams (nala)
* Avoid crossing Manali-Rohtang-Koksar on Tuesday, its closed for maintenance
* Keep all necessary documents at an easily traceable place e.g. tank bag etc
* Water streams (nala) are easier to cross in morning, owing to less water flow
* From Sonamarg to Kargil traffic is allowed during noon hours (1 to 5 PM) only
* Don't stay long at any high altitude point. Mountain sickness can kill your joy
* Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) symptoms are headache, dizziness, fever or vomiting  
* Avoid following any vehicle for long, try to overtake and avoid any pothole/obstacle
* In high altitude regions, apply oil on the belly button, to keep your lips moisturized
* Avoid full tank, keep little bit of air in it. Also keep opening your spare/jerry fuel can
* Remember that civilian traffic is stopped on J&K highways on certain days for armed forces movement
