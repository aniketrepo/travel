==============================================
What is Inner Line Permits (ILP) ??

Inner Line Permit is an official travel document issued by the government of India to allow inward travel of an Indian citizen into a protected/restricted area for a limited period. It is obligatory for Indian citizens from outside those States to obtain permit for entering into the protected State. The document is an effort by the government to regulate movement to certain areas located near the international border of India. This is a security measure and it is applicable for certain parts of Leh.
Earlier Inner line permits were not required for Indian Nationals. ILP were required for Foreign National only. But due to recent heavy traffic of tourist in leh Ladakh, the Ladakh union announced that the environment fees of Rs 400 & Inner Line Permits (most likely as well) has been introduced in Ladakh for Indian Tourists / Nationals with the effect from April 2017. This info is also available on official website of Leh administration. All Indian Nationals and foreign Tourists need to pay environmental fees (Inner line Permits Fees is different for foreign Nationals)

Besides permit application form, you need to write a request application letter addressing DC of Leh – Ladakh district for the approval of your permits. In the application, you need to express your interest to visit the places you wish to travel along with the dates you would be visiting these places in your Leh trip.
Validity of the inner line permits are 1 week for Indians and 1 week for foreigners. However, there is no limit on the number of times you enter a place in the valid period provided you have the permits with you for that place.

But it is advised to keep this advisory in mind while riding in Ladakh.

JULY TO MID AUGUST THERE ARE HEAVY RAINS AND LAND SLIDES COUPLED WITH SNOW STORMS AND AVALANCHES.

FOOD OPTIONS ARE PLENTY IN LEH AND SO ARE THE ATMs. Only Post Paid connections work and WiFi signals are very weak. NO STD booths are now operational in Leh. Carrying a Power Bank for Mobile charging is a good option. Post-Paid BSNL performs Better and Airtel comes second in that sector.

ATM, PETROL PUMPS/MOBILE STATUS -

MOOL-MANTRA OF A SUCCESSFUL RIDE (These points have been chalked out in addition to the general issues taken care of in the Ladakh Planner on this forum).

MANALI-ROHTANG-KOKSAR road remains closed on every TUESDAY during working hours for maintenance.

* Get your bike properly serviced well in time before the start of the ride
* Any bike of 150 CC is good enough. Don’t look for any other bike, if you have full confidence on your 150 CC or bigger bike.
* Carry only the most essential luggage to ride comfortably. Don’t opt for a pillion rider on this tough ride.
* Don’t carry too many tools. Just the most essential like, spark plug, clutch lever assembly, oil seal, shocker seal, engine oil filter, engine oil, chair lubricant (if chain is not covered), chain lock, m.seal, 2" transparent tape, plastic sheet to cover the baggage, puncture kit if you have tubeless tyres, torch, match box, a 3’ transparent tube of small diameter, a few metres of strong winding wire, and other tools of the bikes are enough. These all can be packed in a small packet and kept just within your reach at any point of time. If you can carry air pressure pump that would be an added advantage.
* Just before the day of the start, pack the baggage the night before so that you can start in the wee hours of the day to avoid traffic on highway.
* Try to start by 2.30 to 3.00 a.m. so that by 7 a.m. you are well within the reach of the hills if you have opted Manali route, as in June there would be too much traffic of cyclists and school children on the road after that.
* Do not ride in the outer most lane of NH-1 at night or early hours of the day as due to poor visibility and good speed, you may not be able to see any dead animal which is quite often found on the outermost lane. Sometimes even a dark animal like cow or buffalo would be found roaming on the road. So keep a close look on the highway.When riding in Punjab, keep close watch on the sign boards as most of them are in Punjabi/Gurmukhi.
* Do not follow any car or truck for long, just try to overtake it as in case of any pothole or dead animal, you might not be able to change your course of ride immediately.
* Fog light do help in night ride. Paste good reflecting tapes on the back of your bike.
* If riding in group, change the position of every rider as often as possible so that you can have a fair idea of every rider.
* Once you have entered J & K, the prepaid connections won’t work at all and even the post paid signals would be found quite weak or at places complete nil so need to stay as close as possible in the ride in J & K and Ladakh region.
* Try to start your ride by early hours, be it solo or in groups. As in groups, it is very difficult to keep them focused once you have entered Leh. Quite often the ego problem, or attitude issues of difference of opinion of destination occurs and soon you might find 2 or 3 groups with different opinions within the whole group. Result: By the end of the ride, you might be riding alone or in a small group of 2 or three riders each.
* It is advisable to become a part of an organized group if you are not quite sure of going solo or in small groups. It is always better to complete the big ride since the organiser groups have lot of experience and are always there to help you. They are just like an institution giving degree to its students. They may charge a little more than your expected budget but better be a successful finisher than being a drop out. While riding with organized groups, they keep a tight schedule of each day and try to start at the scheduled time.
* Stop for at least 10 minutes after every 150 to 200kms to cool down your engine as well as the tyres.
* If opting for Srinagar route, follow the road signs closely once you have entered Punjab as most of them are in Gurmukhi.
* Only on day one, whether on Delhi Srinagar route or on Delhi Manali route you can cover over 600 kms in one day. From day 2 you would be riding for around 250 kms max for each day and your average speed of the day would go down to around 35 kms – 40 kms. This is considered good speed in high terrains of ladakh.
* If you have opted Manali route top up the fuel tank the night before as the real test of your riding skill starts from day 2. Start at 4.00 a.m. so that you don’t encounter too much traffic up to Rohtang or up to Marhi. Do check the Map you are carrying as often as possible during the ride now for the next 10 days of your ride minimum.
* When going uphill, change into proper gear before every turn so that you need not change the gear. While taking a left turn since you are bound to take a sharp upward turn to keep yourself in the left side of the road, that is the most crucial moment. Just keep a close watch on the traffic come from the opposite side and if you have a good chance, then take a complete turn and you might have to move towards the extreme right side of the road before coming back to the left side. While riding at single lane road, always try to be away from the cliff.
* While riding through the slush, do not accelerate too much since you might damage your clutch assembly. Just be cool and ask your co riders to push the bike out of the slush. Same is the case while crossing huge water streams. Do not change gears when you are inside the thick of the stream. Move at a constant speed and at low gear while crossing the streams. If got stuck, take the help of the co-riders to push the bike out of the stream. Your shoes and socks might get wet but your bike and luggage would be safe. Remove the socks when you have crossed the stream and change them with a new dry pair of socks. Must carry a bunch of safety pins. Squeeze the extra water from the socks and pin them up with the luggage properly. They would dry within next 30 minutes of your onward ride.
* If carrying own 2-T tent, try to avoid its use enroute Manali Leh highway as it would be extremely cold at night. Better take rest in the make-shift restaurants with sleeping beds. It is quite cheap.
* Do not try to become too friendly with the women managing these restaurants as it is complete no no in that region.
* While riding in higher hills, keep an informal friendly eye contact with the riders or drivers of the other vehicles and give them a thumbs up. In distress they would be the first to help you in those desolate terrains.
* Do not ride after dark in higher terrain. It normally gets quite foggy and may rain in upper hills in the evening hours. If you encounter hard ice, ride carefully. If it becomes too difficult, you might have to come back to lower levels to avoid being stranded in extreme hostile weather conditions at the top.
* Do keep a close check on the oil level in the engine every day. For bulletteers there is often issue of loose nut bolts. Just check them every day before the start of the ride and may be within the ride. Do not carry too much luggage, even if you are having a Ladakh Carrier.
* While riding to other parts of Ladakh from Leh you can carry the most essential items with you and leave the rest with the hotel in the clock room to be collected while on your return. If you are wearing a riding jacket and riding pant, you might initially have to remove the inner thermal layers as you might feel comfortable but as you gain height, you might have to wear them so keep them just within your reach before it feels un-comfortably cold.
* Instead of wearing to many woolen clothes, wear two three layers of fleece t shirts under the riding jacket so that if you feel hot you can remove the layers as many times as you like.

WINTER CHADAR TREK & WINTER DRIVE TO PANGONG/K.TOP

FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR CHADAR TREK -
WINTER IN LADAKH

IMPORTANT NOTE: All trekkers for chadar will now have to get themselves medically examined at SNM Hospital Leh between 2-3 p.m. on second day of their arrival in leh. This medical examination shall be made mandatory from 2019 Chadar trek season in its absence no trekker will be able to cross chilling check post.

BEST TIME : 7th January to 7th February
AIR FARE DELHI-LEH-LED : Approx 6000-7000 if booked well in time Must dress adequately before alighting from plane in leh.

MOBILE BATTERY : Doesn't drain fast if kept in inside pockets of jacket or sleeping bag at night. But do carry Power Bank of 10,000+ mh and keep them inside pocket of jackets. Handling of DSLRs is a tricky affair as one slip on ice or from cliff hanger can damage it.
INTERNET/MOBILE NETWORK : No network at all once you enter the trek region beyond Nimmu i.e. the confluence of Indus and Zanskar River.

1. Budget : Rs. 17500/- onwards depending on which group you have opted for. Excluding air fare. Keep extra cash and debit card for incidental expenses.

2. Minimum Days required for trek to Nerak Frozen Waterfall : Seven days excluding buffer days for acclimatization and last minute shopping in leh and departure from Leh.

3. Distance advisable to be covered each day : 9 -10 kms. Most of the time you would be traveling through deep gorge. It's not windy out there. Camping will be available in open or on last day in Cave after Tibb.

4. State of Ice Sheet to be trekked upon : Uneven and fragile at lots of places. You need to climb up the mountain with minimal support 7-8 times minimum

5. Temperature : Days are comfortable but at night not advisable to continue after Sunset as it might drop below -25 degree.

6. Head Torch and Gum Boots (Diamond or Columbus having Rubber Sole costing @ 300-350 can be easily purchased from LEH market near car parking lot), trekking stick are a must. 3 pairs each of woolen and nylon socks advisable. Besides you need to keep hot water in steel thermos daily. You might have to climb steep cliffs too number of times or crawl on the hard ice passage hardly two feet wide at places alongside the river.

7. Wear layers of clothes for day trek, avoid jeans. And do carry an extra thick woolen jacket and trousers in case you get caught in snowfall.

8. Waterproof pant is a must besides the Upper also. Three layers of lower are must while trekking.

9. Some trekkers felt comfortable in ordinary woolen gloves @ 100/- with extra layer of thin gloves inside but won't advise for that. Check at decathlon too.

10. Need first layer of inner thermals and a fleece jacket in addition to a down jacket besides a full sleeve synthetic t shirt. Carry extra quick dry pair of clothes and towel and sanitary paper roll too.

11. Woolen Balaclava is also available at Decathlon @ 199/-

12. UV Goggles, Lip Guard and Sunscreen 30+ SPF is advisable. No need to look for 100 SPF sunscreen lotion

13. Very few guest houses (at LEH, Nubra, Pangong tso) and shops are functional in LEH in winter though many Ladakh Return members who met me at LEH just paid @ 300/- onwards per head with heater facility for accommodation at Fort Road, Old Fort Road and near market at car parking. If you find accommodation @ 500/- approx per head with heater facility that's also good

14. Extra Porter charges range @ Rs. 600/- onwards per day for Chadar Trek. Few trek organisers do provide them at this rate if informed in advance.

15. If you intend to visit Pangong tso or Nubra valley or Khardungla do check the weather and road status. Always insist for carrying snow chain to the taxi owner as weather can take a turn anytime at the top.

16. Taxi for 5 passengers can be bargained @ Rs. 6000/- or a little higher for one day trip to Pangong tso though few tour organisers charge much too high.

17.Taxi for Khardungla top can bargain for Rs. 2000/- but do insist on carrying snow chains

ADVISORY : 1.Please do not undertake trek in case there is weather warning of SNOWFALL in the region. MUST FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS OF GUIDE during the entire trek.

2. Do carry your regular medicines. Carry good quality hot water Thermos and dry fruits.

3. This trek is not advisable for children below 16 years as I feel.

5. DO NOT join a trek organiser who has NO PAST TREK RECORD of CHADAR TREK. It can take a ugly turn due to his inexperience and poor planning.

6. LIFE IS PRECIOUS. DO NOT COMPROMISE ON LOGISTIC SUPPORT and EXPERIENCE OF TREK ORGANIZER.

7. ON our way back from Chadar Trek on 15th January we were bewildered to find hordes of trekkers and porters (around 250 trekkers and 350+ porters) as per general information we got. Wonder if they did find enough space for camping at all not to forget the fate of Chadar on each day of their trek.

8. DUE TO frequent weather disturbances flights get delayed OR Cancelled for days from LEH especially in winters.

9. Reach at least two days in advance for acclimatization and stay indoors on day 1. Keep buffer days for Return as flight gets cancelled due to extreme weather.
