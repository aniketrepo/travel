#	Philosophy	
*	God made each one of us, but some weirds like me, has received immense energies
*	God gave me strong genetics, which i dont want to waste in sedentry life. I will use this energy and experience the life!
*	My high energy has always attracted people, but all attractions soons fades away, after facing my heat
*	During all these years, i found that motercycle riding is my best way to desipate my high energy and stay peacefull with people around me

##  4:10 AM Ghaziabad
*	As always, early start of day and i am ready with my motercycle, ready with my complete riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, i am traversing through Ghaziabad city
* 	Arrived at NH-58, this is the highway to take me to Uttarakhand, my destination state
*	Only heavy vehicles present on the road but some taxis also riding in speed

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	Another solo rider, on a Bajaj Pulsar has just passed me, waving me in confidence
*	I hooked to his tail with my all senses opened to judge, the slitest of movement around my motercycle
* 	We carefully steered through the traffic around us, and attracted the eyes of many 
* 	We crossed Modinagar and arrived at Meerut bypass, where i took the lead, and finally throttled my best
*	Here comes the bullet attitude, but with all senses opened to avoid any mistake
*	Solo riding makes you more responsibile, to avoid any negligence, and eventually avoiding any disaster

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Arrived in Meerut but still no sign of sunlight, i am feeling confident to reach my destination within stipiulated time
*	At my maximum crusing speed of 80 KMPS, which is only possible in such minimal traffic, in India
*	Heading towards Muzaffarnagar, on clear roads
*	Another large biker group, at a very coordinated and controlled pace, mostly Haryana number plates
*	I waved the group and accelerated, able to see the sunlight now

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Highest cane growing fields of India are, all around me. It gives me proud to born with my agricultural legacy
*	This new highway is the face of new face of emerging India. 
*	People in my generation, who are experiencing this change, will have a story to tell to new generations
*	Slolwy the highway came to end. I am entering the single side rode soon, heading towards Roorkee

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most Engineering Institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school busses are ferrying kids are staffs
*	I can see uniform clad elegant female Army doctors, heading for their work
*	First sign of Uttarakhand Police, on every cornor of city
*	I am easily traversing through calm roads of city, happy to skip the worst traffic of this city
*	Soon back on nice highway again. Throttle is to my maximum cruising speed, heading for cities of Gods

##  8:00 AM Haridwar
*	Arrived on time, Hill life is waiting for me, throttled again to max, towards Rishikesh
*	While crossing the Rajapur sentury, i started feeling the hill vibes
*	A small pee stop and after collecting my energies, i climbed again on my 9 years old companion
*	Unstopped untill i arrived on a train crossing, felt good to break all my previous records of covering the maximum distance
*	A curious lad is questioned by me, he felt respected and helped me to clarify the next road to be taken for Narendra Nagar

##  8:45 AM Rishikesh
*	Arrived at spirtual capital of India, but soon took a left turn to skip its abode beautifull ashrams
*	Hill climb is started, steep turns quickly alerted my throttled hungry mind to slow down
*	No sign of traffic, i am mostly alone on these roads
