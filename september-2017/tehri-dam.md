##  4:10 AM Ghaziabad
*	As always, early start of day and i am ready with my motercycle
*	I am riding with my complete gear and heading towards NH-24
*	Traffic is very light and no sign of sunlight, i am passing through Ghaziabad city and arrived at NH-58
* 	This is the highway to take me to Uttarakhand, my destination state.
*	Only heavy traffic but light is present on the road, few taxis are also traversing through traffic

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	Another solo rider, on a Bajaj Pulsar has just passed me, giving me a confidence
*	I hooked to his tail with my all senses opened to judge, the slitest of movement around my motercycle
* 	We carefully steered through the traffic around us, and attracted the eyes of many vehicles
* 	We crossed Modinagar and arrived at Meerut bypass, where i took the lead, and finally throttled my best

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Arrived Meerut and still there no sign of sunlight, i am feeling confident to reach my destination within stipiulated time
