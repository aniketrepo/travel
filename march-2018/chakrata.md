##  4:00 AM Ghaziabad
*	Its been four months of hibernation, no riding since November last year
*	Slept for four hours and woke up at 3 o'clock. All packings were done before sleeping
*	My bag full of most of things, which i wish never to use like puncure kits, spare parts, first aid etc
*	Several new additions in my kit, from the learnings from last mistakes e.g. first aid kit

*	Eager to throttle again, I am ready to track another hill of Uttarakhand; my favourite place to find peace and happiness
*	Few glasses of water and a tea, before heading out alone with nine years old companion; my Enfleid Electra

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	This is the one of the notorious highway; famous for its traffic jams
*	I want to skip the rush of plane and glide into the heavenly abode of mountains
*	State of solace arrives; internal dialogue between mind and heart is started to culminate
*	I am connected with my motercycle, and able to feel the healthy thump of its engine
*	Newly installed fog lights are doing magic and i dont feel any need of the main headlamp
*	Not able to see any long distance rider, but i know there are many souls i will meet on the way

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Bypassed Meerut city, took the left turn and riding on a better road to Haridwar
*	No sign of sun lights, some village boys are doing morning run, aspiring to join armed forces of india
*	I was recalling my old days, when i use to run barefoot and testing my physical endurance
*	And i am passed by few riders on KTM Duke motercycle, gone like a wind
*	There are various types of rider spirits; i felt like i am the slowest one!

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Bypassing one of the oldest city of Uttar Pradesh
*	Its the last days of north Indian winter and i am stiff like log. I am using the famous breathing techniques of The Iceman [Wim Hoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof) 
*	Few minor stops to empty my bladder and take pictures of growing wheat crop

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Roorkee has a large Indian Army base; which is home of the famous Bengal Sappers
*	Decided to take a long course this time and headed towards Haridwar
*	Took some time to cross the city; the bypass is still in making, hope to avoid this city one day
*	Arrived on the highway, which is still in construction mode, but still its far better than the previous single lane
*	Crossing famous Patanjali, an overbridge is under construction here, slowing down the traffic 

##  7:45 AM Haridwar
*	Arrived in the famous city of Gods. Crossing the tall Statue of Lord Shiva and heading towards Rishikesh through Rajaji National Park
*	Minor stop on the Railway crossing and attracted few school going kids, which are for sure dreaming themselves like me someday

##  8:15 AM Raiwala
*	My sunglasses are out to avoid the glare. Stopped at the petrol pump to fillup the tank before taking the left turn to Dehradun road
