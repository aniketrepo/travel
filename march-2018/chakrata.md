##  4:00 AM Ghaziabad
*	Its been four months of hibernation, no riding since November last year
*	Slept around 4 hours, i woke up at 3 o'clock. All packings were done before sleeping
*	My bag full of most of things, which i wish never to use like puncure kits, spare parts, first aid etc
*	Several new additions in my kit, from the learnings from last mistakes e.g. first aid kit

*	Eager to throttle again, I am ready to track another hill of Uttarakhand; my favourite place to hang out
*	Few glasses of water and a tea, before heading out alone with nine years old companion; my Enfleid Electra
