##  4:00 AM Ghaziabad
*	Its been four months of hibernation, no riding since November last year
*	Slept for four hours and woke up at 3 o'clock. Packing was done before sleeping
*	My bag full of most of things, which i wish never to use like puncture kits, spare parts, first aid etc.
*	Several new additions in my kit, from the learnings from last mistakes e.g. first aid kit

*	Eager to throttle again, I am ready to track another hill of Uttarakhand; my favorite place to find peace and happiness
*	Few glasses of water and a tea, before heading out alone with nine years old companion; my Enfield Electra

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	This is the one of the notorious highway; famous for its traffic jams
*	I want to skip the rush of plane and glide into the heavenly abode of mountains
*	State of solace arrives; internal dialog between mind and heart is started to culminate
*	I am connected with my motorcycle, and able to feel the healthy thump of its engine
*	Newly installed fog lights are doing magic and i don't feel any need of the main headlamp
*	Not able to see any long distance rider, but i know there are many souls i will meet on the way

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Bypassed Meerut city, took the left turn and riding on a better road to Haridwar
*	No sign of sun lights, some village boys are doing morning run, aspiring to join armed forces of India
*	I was recalling my old days, when i use to run barefoot and testing my physical endurance
*	And i am passed by few riders on KTM Duke motorcycle, gone like a wind
*	There are various types of rider spirits; i felt like i am the slowest one!

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	Bypassing one of the oldest city of Uttar Pradesh, back in days very famous for crimes
*	It’s the last days of north Indian winter and i am stiff like log. I am using the famous breathing techniques of The Iceman [Wim Hoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof) 
*	Few minor stops to empty my bladder and take pictures of growing wheat crop

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Roorkee has a large Indian Army base; which is home of the famous Bengal Sappers
*	Decided to take a long course this time and headed towards Haridwar
*	Took some time to cross the city; the bypass is still in making, hope to avoid this city one day

*	Crossing famous Patanjali, an over bridge is under construction here, slowing down the traffic 

##  7:45 AM Haridwar

*	Pulled my sunglasses out to face the scorching sun. Stopped at the petrol pump to fill up the tank before taking the left turn to my next stop Dehradun
*	It’s getting hot now and another 100 kilometers of ride ahead. Taking few minor stops here and there for hydration and pee
*	These rides are the best way to increase my psychological and physical limits; I am always thankful to spirits, for always taking care of me

##  8:50 AM Chidderwala
*	A small town which is witnessing the growth story of Indian highways. The road is under construction here
*	I eat minimal while i ride; to cultivate my physical and mental endurance. Keeping a bottle of water and a small box of dry fruits to survive
*	Took a stop and consumed some dry fruits for deferring the hunger while watching the growing wheat crop in fields which is almost a month away before its ripening

##  9:30 AM Rampur

*	Life is slow at such distant places. So lucky are the people of such places; who live in the pollution free zones

##  9:50 AM Sahaspur
*	Crossing this small town to find the Vikas Nagar Chakrata road, which is going to take us to our destination
*	Stopped for few minutes on the bridge, took pictures, hills are visible from here

##  4:50 PM Tiger Fall
*	Its a near by place, you need to track down for the water fall for around five hundred meters 
*	Beautiful raw scenic place with almost no commercial activity. Its evening and there was very limited people

*	Entire days tiredness is lost after a tea at small nearby shack 

![](https://github.com/inbravo/travel/blob/master/march-2018/images/c/IMG_20180310_163851.jpg)

*	Talked with the guard of fall named Dayaram, talks with him reveals the beautiful nature of mountain natives
*	Finally when the darkness starting taking cover, i decided to ride back to the Chakrata town
*	Took around 45 minutes to return back to Chakrata. After unpacking my gears, i headed for the same restaurant where i ate lunch	
*	Came back to hotel at around 8 o'clock. Finally sitting in peace and thinking about entire day
*	Next morning i will head out to my home, i will ride slow as much as possible to enjoy the journey 

##  Next day 10:00 AM Chakrata
*	Packed my belongings and wore all my gears, before kicking my motorcycle
*	around 9 hours ride in front of me, this time i am taking different route, which is comparatively shorter from the previous one  
*	Took pictures of several places while returning back. After all pictures are the only source of remembering these beautiful moments of my life
