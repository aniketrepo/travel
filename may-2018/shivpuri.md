##  4:00 AM Ghaziabad
*	We all are bound in some priorities and limitations, but we all want to enjoy the life of a traveler
*	I did several rides, but never documented it. Some of close friends, always desired to feel my rides vicariously
*	This travelogue is dedicated to my friends, who want to feel my travel experience and imagine their own journey
*	I had never thought of doing solo rides, but universe has planned it for me
*	It started several years ago, when I bought my first Royal Enfield in 2008 with the intentions of riding experience
*	During all these years, I found that solo motorcycling is best way to find peace with myself
*	I thank to God for giving me strong genetics, which I can use to ride almost nonstop, almost untired
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, ready with my complete riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, I am traversing through Ghaziabad city
* 	Arrived at NH-58, this is the highway to take me to Uttarakhand, my destination state
*	Only heavy vehicles present on the road but there are some taxis ferrying interstate travelers

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	Another solo rider, on a Bajaj Pulsar has just passed me, waving me in confidence
*	I hooked to his tail with my all senses opened to judge, the slightest of movement around my motorcycle
* 	We carefully steered through the traffic around us, and attracted the eyes of many 
* 	We crossed Modinagar and arrived at Meerut bypass, where i took the lead, and finally throttled my best
*	Finally i was in bullet attitude, but with all senses opened to avoid any mistake and started cutting the traffic
*	Solo riding makes you more responsible, you have to avoid every small negligence, which eventually helps in avoiding any disaster

##  5:00 AM Meerut
*	Arrived in Meerut but still no sign of sunlight, i am feeling confident to reach my destination within stipulated time
*	At my maximum cruising speed of 80 KMPS, which is only possible in such minimal traffic, in India
*	Heading towards Muzaffarnagar, on clear roads. Another large biker group, at a very coordinated and controlled pace, mostly Haryana number plates
*	I waved the group and accelerated, able to see the sunlight now

##  6:00 AM Muzaffarnagar
*	This new highway is the face of new emerging India. It gives me immense proud to born in such a great period of transformation 
*	People in my generation, who are experiencing this change, will have a story to tell to new generations
*	India's highest sugarcane growing fields are all around me. Greenery is the major sign of this region
*	Slowly the highway came to end, entering the single side road, heading towards Roorkee city

##  6:50 AM Roorkee
*	Old classical city, has a reputation of one of the top most engineering Institute of India, known as IIT
*	City is full of life and school buses are ferrying kids and staffs. I can see uniform clad elegant female Army doctors, heading for their work
*	I am getting first sign of Uttarakhand Police. I am easily traversing through roads and happy to avoid the notorious traffic jams of this city
*	Soon back to the nice highway again. Throttled to my maximum cruising speed, heading for the city of Gods

##  8:00 AM Haridwar
*	Arrived on time, Hill life is waiting for me, throttled again to max, towards Rishikesh
*	While crossing the Rajaji National Part, I started feeling the hill vibes
*	A small pee stop and after collecting my energies, I climbed again on my 9 years old companion
*	Unstopped until I arrived on a train crossing, felt good to break all my previous records of covering the maximum distance
*	A curious lad is questioned by me, he delightedly guided me towards the road to Narendra Nagar

##  8:45 AM Rishikesh
*	Arrived at spiritual capital of India, but took a left turn to skip its beautiful ashrams and Ganga ghats
*	Hill climb is started, steep turns quickly alerted my throttle hungry mind to slow down
*	No sign of traffic, I am mostly alone on these curvy roads. The best part of journey is around me now ... Hills!
