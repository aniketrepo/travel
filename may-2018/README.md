---

##  Ghaziabad (4:00 AM)
*	This time some of the office colleagues are traveling with us. Two motorcycles and two cars
*	As usual we have decided to start early today to avoid the scorching sun of north India
*	After few calls of coordination with other group travelers, we have decided to start earlier than cars and later join them in Haridwar
*	Heading towards Meerut bypass with headlights on and throttle at around ~70
*	This month is very popular for the kids summer vacations and i am sure to see large traffic soon

##  Muradnagar (4:30 AM)
*	As usual lots of Delhi numbered cars heading towards Uttarakhand
* 	I am eager to take canal road and shorten my travel route
* 	After crossing the peripheral expressway, taken the left turn at Ganga canal and throttled to my favorite speed ~70 

##  Haridwar (8:00 AM)
*	Arrived at Haridwar and taken the road to Chandi Mata temple, also going through famous Hydro power project named Chilla Dam

##  Shivpuri (10:00 AM)
* 	Taken a breakfast pause in Rishikesh and finally arrived at our final destination Shivpuri
* 	Shivpuri is the famous spot for white water river rafting
*	We have stay arrangements for tonight at a camp 500 meter uphill from the road
*	We parked our motorcycle before short climb to the camp
*	Welcomed by the drinks and refreshers in the camp and slowly we started familiarizing with the nature
*	Camp is surrounded by hills and forest, small streams of water flowing nearby

*	Bath at the Ganga was the best thing of the day, felt very relaxed and calm post it

*	We back in camp and started our rounds of beer and wine and enjoyed untill 10 o'clock
*	Completely relaxed and full of fun and entertainment, we called it the end of today and slept on the folding beds
*	It was so nice to wakeup to the sounds of birds chirps, it was very early and we slept very well
*	Few of us decided to go for hike to nearby hills to enjoy the nature
