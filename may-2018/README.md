##  4:00 AM Ghaziabad
*	This time some of the office colleagues are traveling with us. Two motorcycles and two cars
*	As usual we have decided to start early today to avoid the scorching sun of north India
*	After few calls of coordination with other group travelers, we have decided to start earlier than cars and later join them in Haridwar
*	Heading towards Meerut bypass with headlights on and throttle at around ~70
*	This month is very popular for the kids summer vacations and i am sure to see large traffic soon

##  4:30 AM Modinagar
*	As usual lots of Delhi numbered cars heading towards Uttarakhand
