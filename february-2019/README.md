##  Ghaziabad to Haridwar
*	I was supposed to be at Banaras today, the holy city of India but my train tickets are not confirmed
*	At around 10:00 PM yesterday, i realized that one of colleague has also invited us for this marriage
*	Rishikesh is mentioned as venue of marriage in his invitation, which stuck my head for a minute
*	Instantly decided to travel to Rishikesh and at 5:00 AM i am heading towards canal road from Muradnagar
*	Beautiful morning and most of the canal road is without much traffic, taking the benefit to cruising fast
*	Todays plan is to visit a place of spiritual significance, 35 kms from Rishikesh on NH-58 towards Devprayag
*	Gufa is a word in Hindi which means Cave in English. Vashisth gufa is a around 10 meters cave
*	Sage Vashisth has meditated in  this cave. This place is maintained as a ashram and many sages live here
*	River Ganga flows nearby and the whole ambiance is so tranquil and rejuvenating
