##  4:10 AM Ghaziabad
*	We all are bound in some priorities and limitations, but we all want to enjoy the life of a traveler
*	I did several rides, but never documented it. Some of close friends, always desired to feel my rides vicariously
*	This travelogue is dedicated to my friends, who want to feel my travel experience and imagine their own journey
*	I had never thought of doing solo rides, but universe has planned it for me
*	It started several years ago, when I bought my first Royal Enfield in 2008 with the intentions of riding experience
*	During all these years, I found that solo motorcycling is best way to find peace with myself
*	I thank to God for giving me strong genetics, which I can use to ride almost nonstop, almost untired
*	As always, early start of day and I am ready with my motorcycle, ready with my complete riding gears
*	Heading towards NH-24, light traffic and no sunlight, I am traversing through Ghaziabad city
* 	Arrived at NH-58, this is the highway to take me to Uttarakhand, my destination state
*	Only heavy vehicles present on the road but there are some taxis ferrying interstate travelers
