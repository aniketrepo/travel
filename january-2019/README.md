*	Elevation of Kedarkantha is 12,500 ft located within Govind Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttarkashi
*	Boarded to train and settled for the sleep so that i can stay ready for tomorrows 8 hours hill drive 
*	Arrived at Dehradun early morning and soon found a shared cab to Sankari
*	Todays journey going to be through Mussoorie, Barkot and Naugaon. This route take you to famous pilgrimages Yamunotri and Gangotri
*	It was a very tiring ride, cab stopped at several places where i clicked some of the pictures
*	Reached Sankari before the sunset, its a small village where the tracks for Harki Doon and Kedarkantha starts
*	The most exciting thing is that our stay is with a village family, in their traditional low rise wooden house
*	Next morning I will start the hike early morning with a group of around 20 people	
*	At the night the entire group met and our hiking leader explained us the plan and procedures
*	A delecious dinner was served to us and post that the entire group introduced with each other
