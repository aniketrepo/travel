##  4:10 AM Ghaziabad
*	Delay of ten minutes from proposed start time, Which is acceptable if initial 100 kilometers are covered unstopped
*	Me (Enfield Electra), Deepak (Bajaj Avenger) and Digvijay (Bajaj Pulsar) heading for our first stop to Gajraula
*	We are riding together first time but with a common interest, called Riding...
*	I am riding with a helmet as the only protacting gear. Which i later realized, a great risk
*	Traffic is very light but no sunlight. We are riding with headlights on

##  5:45 AM Gajraula
*	Rode for 95 kilometers from our homes, arrived on Chandpur road at Gajraula. Emptied our bladder and restarted
*	Next stop Chandpur is 50 kilometers. Road is nice but single sided, which forced us to reduce out top speeds
*	Took a minor stop of 10 minutes, at some mid point, quickly checked goodle map to avoid any deviation

##  6:30 AM Chandpur
*	Its wee hours and life is comming back on roads. School kids and peasents started to resume the daily life
*	Chandpur is alive and we crossed it without slightest of traffic snarls
*	Next stop is 16 kilometers, known as Noorpur, a small town
*	While riding to Noorpur, i got a bee stung, almost felt like a warm piercing in my left shoulder. Spent 5 minutes to regain my energy and restarted
*	Lesson learnt from bee incident: **Always wear riding jacket and leave no open gates for bugs!!**

##  6:55 AM Noorpur
*	Swiftly crossed Noorpur. Nothing slowed our speeds, despite of regular day activities of city
*	We are heading to Nehtaur, which is 20 kilometers away

##  7:30 AM Nehtaur
*	Nehtaur is cloacked. We are feeling good after successfully crossing the maximum distance without any traffic
*	Next stop is Nazibabad, which is 50 kilometers

##  8:20 AM Nazibabad
*	Nazibabad was slightly busy but it has not taken much time to cross the town
*	Eventually the breeze became cooler and roadsides became greener, which our eyes were fervently waiting for 3 hours
*	Passing through jungle road with almost no traffic, soothened our ruffled feathers and reduced our riding fatigue
*	Next stop is Kotdwar, which is 25 kilometers

##  8:50 AM Kotdwar
*	And finaly we are in Uttarakhand, the neighbout state of Uttar Pradesh
*	Stopped at a small eatry, ate sumptous aloo parathas with butter and aachar, scrounged enough to give us the ability to survive for complete day

##	10:00 AM Paudi to Lansdowne Road
*	After riding for around 45 minutes, we finally arrived on the entry gate of Lansdowne but the main place is still 22 kilometers up hills
*	Spent here some time in capturing beautifull mooments

##  10:45 AM Dugadda
*	We have crossed Dugadda and now enjoyoing the scenic beauty of hills
*	Its raining on and off, but we did not stopped riding

##  11:00 AM Kho River
*	After crossing 6 kilometers from Dugadda, arrived at Kho river pass
*	Feelings to take bath could not stop us and we were in clean water within few minutes
*	A small mid aged group of south Delhi males, was enjoying the bath and booze
*	It took us minutes to remove all our clothes and jumping in cold water of Kho river
*	Water is always a natural smoother to us, and it was natural hill water, which increased the enjoyment
*	A water snake ehnanced our adventure and forced us all to run away. Snake kept starring us, and we kept laughing and joking
*	We have encashed the cost of long drive so far. Few more people from Delhi, joined us meanwhile
*	Finally after complete refreshment, we decided to ride again and enjoy the hill beauty

##  12:00 PM Kho River to Lensdowne
*	Started climbing the mountain again after getting refreshed
*	After climbing for another 15 minutes, with a quick jerk, my bullets clutch wire decided to say adios to me
*	Bike is stopped and i am trying to understand the reason of failure, at the middle of no mans land
*	Last town to get repaired is 8 kilometers behind, next is 14 kilometers far
*	Boldness is always rewarded!!! I decided to ride uphill without clutch, may sound scary to few but its not that difficult for regular bike riders
* 	We are riding in clouds now and its magical to feel the chill. Body is drenched with rain and mild drizzling of clouds

##  12:30 PM Lansdowne
*	Finally we arrived at Lansdownde and our search for a mechanic is also ended. My stallion received a new clutch wire within 30 minutes

##  2:00 PM Lansdowne
*	Lansdowne, at a height of 5,800 ft (1,800 m) above sea level, is the recruitment centre of the Garhwal Rifles
*	War history of [Garhwal Rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garhwal_Rifles) is worth respect and reverence
*	Lansdowne was founded and named after then Viceroy of India (1888-1894), Lord Lansdowne in 1887
*	The War Memorial (Darban Singh Museum), near the Parade Ground of the Garhwal Rifles Center, is worth a visit, if you love history	
*	Good part of Lensdown is that its not commercialized, some of its attractions are
	- Bhulla lake
	- Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple
    - Bhim Pakora
    - Kaleshwar Mahadev Mandir
