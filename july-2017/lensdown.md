##  4:10 AM Ghaziabad
*	Delay of ten minutes from proposed start time
*	Which is acceptable if initial 100 kilometers are covered before first stop
*	Me (Enfield Electra), Deepak (Bajaj Avenger) and Digvijay (Bajaj Pulsar) heading for out first stop to Gajraula
*	We are riding together first time but with a common interest, called Riding...
*	I am riding with a helmet as the only protacting gear. Which i later realized, a great risk
*	Traffic is very light but no sunlight. We are riding with headlights on

##  5:45 AM Gajraula
*	Rode for 95 kilometers from our homes, arrived on Chandpur road at Gajraula. Emptied your bladder and restarted
*	Next stop is Chandpur is 50 kilometers. Road is nice but single side, which forced us to reduce out top speeds
*	Took a minor stop of 10 minutes, at some mid point, checked goodle map to avoid any deviation

##  6:30 AM Chandpur
*	Its wee hours and life is comming back on roads. School kids and peasents started to throng in on road
*	Chandpur is alive and we crossed it without slightest of traffic snarls
*	Next stop is only 16 kilometers, known as Noorpur, a small town
*	While riding to Noorpur, i got a bee stung, almost felt like a warm piercing in my left shoulder. Spent 5 minutes to regain my energy and restarted

##  6:55 AM Noorpur
*	Crossed from Noorpur. Nothing obstructive in terms of slowing our speeds
*	We are heading to Nehtaur, which is only 20 kilometers away

##  7:30 AM Nehtaur
*	Nehtaur is cloacked. We are feeling good to cross the maximum plain without any traffic
*	Next stop is Nazibabad, which is 50 kilometers

##  8:20 AM Nazibabad
*	Nazibabad was slightly busy but did not took much time for us to cross
*	There came the road, which was our eyes were fervently waiting for
*	Passing through jungle road with almost no traffic, soothened our ruffled feathers
*	Next stop is Kotdwar, which is only 25 kilometers

##  8:50 AM Kotdwar
*	And finaly we are in Uttarakhand, the neighbout state of Uttar Pradesh
*	Stopped at a small eatry, ate sumptous aloo parathas with butter and aachar, scrounged enough to give us the ability to survive for complete day

##	10:00 AM Paudi to Lansdowne Road
*	After riding for around 45 minutes, we finally arrived on the entry gate of Lansdowne but the main place is still 22 kilometers up hills

##  12:00 PM Kho River to Lensdowne
*	Started climbing the mountain again after getting refreshed
*	After climbing for another 15 minutes, with a quick jerk, my bullets clutch wire decided to say adios to me
*	Bike is stopped and i am trying to understand the reason of failure, at the middle of no mans land
*	Last town to get repaired is 8 kilometers behind, next is 14 kilometers far
*	Boldness is always rewarded!!! 
*	I decided to rode uphill without clutch, may sound scary to few but its not that difficult for regular bike riders and a habitual offender
* We are riding in clouds now and its magical to feel the chill. Body is drenched with rain and mild drizzling of clouds
