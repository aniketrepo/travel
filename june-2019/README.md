| This is the story of my motorcycle ride to Khardungla Leh J&K, India|

---

##  Ghaziabad
*	June 30, 2019, the plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to Worlds highest motorable pass: Khardungla
*	Khardungla holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	Khardungla is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude
*	Unpredictable snow and rain, make Khardungla worse, specially for two wheeler riders
*	This is my second trip to Laddakh region. As planed, left at 3:15 AM from home
*	This is one of the hottest days of north Indian summers. By noon planning to reach J&K
*	At Karnal i realized that my luggage carrier is broken and hanging from one side
*	My eyes started searching for a welder and soon found a welding shop and get it fixed

*	Somewhere near Phagwara in Punjab, decided to take lunch at a road side eatery called dhaba
*	Reached Mukerian. Again a small halt at cold drink shop and enjoyed talking with an old man and his son

*	Arrived in Samba and instead of going towards Jammu, decided to take a short cut to Udhampur, J&K
*	Road from Samba to Udhampur is not of good condition, but its scenic and fun to ride through mountains
