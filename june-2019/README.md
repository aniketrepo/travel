---

##  Ghaziabad
*	June 30, 2019, today is the day, for which i have planned and visualized several times in my thoughts
*	The plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to the Worlds highest motorable pass called, Khardungla
*	This pass holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	This pass is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude. Unpredictable snow and rain, make it worse specially for two wheeler riders
*	Khardungla holds a unique value in the eyes of all motorcycle riders, like a Makka of Motorcyclists
*	This is my second trip to Laddakh region. I have been riding long distance motorcycle since 2015, which has made me more experienced in terms of facing the adversities of such rides
*	Plan is to start 3:00 AM to cover as much as possible on day 1. We left our homes at around 3:15 AM almost on time
*	This is one of the hottest days of north Indian summers. By noon we are planning to each Mukerian, Punjab
*	At Karnal i realized that my luggage carrier is broken and hanging from one side. My eyes started searching for a welding shop nearby the road
*	Somewhere near Phagwara in Punjab, we decided to take lunch at a road side eatery called dhaba. Stayed there for around 1 hours to regain some energies and rest
*	Restarted again and reached Mukerian, Punjab. Again a halt of almost 2 hours and enjoyed talking with an old man and his son. We enjoyed their famous lime water
*	We arrived in Samba and instead of going towards Jammu, decided to take a short cut to Udhampur, J&K
*	Road from Samba to Udhampur is no more a highway but a small town road, but its scenic and fun to ride in mountains

##  Udhampur
*	Taking minor stops here and there, we are finally arrived at Udhampur at 9:00 PM. This city is slept
*	We are able to find a place for the night, hotel Subhash. Decided to stay here after a small bargain and settled in our rooms
*	My usual meditation session before going into deep sleep, helped me to balance my energies after almost 670 kilometers journey of today 
*	As we planned, we left our hotels by 8:00 AM towards Srinagar. Todays journey is going to very scenic going through hills, rivers, tunnels and valley
