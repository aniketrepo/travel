---

##  Ghaziabad
*	June 30, 2019, the plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to Worlds highest motorable pass: Khardungla
*	This pass holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	This pass is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude
*	Unpredictable snow and rain, make it worse, specially for two wheeler riders
*	Khardungla holds a unique value in the eyes of all motorcycle riders, like a Makka of Motorcyclists
*	This is my second trip to Laddakh region. As planed, left at 3:15 AM from home
*	This is one of the hottest days of north Indian summers. By noon planning to reach J&K
*	At Karnal i realized that my luggage carrier is broken and hanging from one side
*	My eyes started searching for a welder and soon found a welding shop and get it fixed
*	Somewhere near Phagwara in Punjab, decided to take lunch at a road side eatery called dhaba
*	Reached Mukerian. Again a small halt at cold drink shop and enjoyed talking with an old man and his son
*	Arrived in Samba and instead of going towards Jammu, decided to take a short cut to Udhampur, J&K
*	Road from Samba to Udhampur is not of good condition, but its scenic and fun to ride through mountains

##  Udhampur
*	Taking minor stops here and there, finally arrived at Udhampur at 9:00 PM
*	Able to find a place for the night, hotel Subhash. After a small bargain, settled in room
*	A small meditation session, helped me to balance my energies after almost 670 kilometers journey of today 
*	Next morning, heading towards Srinagar, passing through bridges, tunnels and valley on NH 44
*	After almost 30 minutes ride, arrived at [Chenani-Nashri Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenani-Nashri_Tunnel)
*	Scrounged delicious apricots, which are famous in this region. Which will fulfill my glucose need of entire day

##  Banihal
*	A small hill town, Indian railways has recently marked its presence in this town
*	This is auspicious season of Ramadan and mosques are playing soothing prayer on loudspeakers
*	Next week is going to be Eid, the holy festival of Muslims
*	After few minor
