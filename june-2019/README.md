| This is the story of my motorcycle ride to Khardungla Leh J&K, India|

##  Ghaziabad
*	Today is the day, for which i have planned and visualized several times in my thoughts
*	The plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to the Worlds highest motorable pass called, Khardungla
*	This pass holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	This pass is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude
*	Unpredictable snow and rain, make it worse for two wheeler riders
*	Khardungla holds a unique value in the eyes of all motorcycle riders, like a Makka of Motorcyclists
