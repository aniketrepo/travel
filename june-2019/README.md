| This is the story of my motorcycle ride to Khardungla Leh J&K, India|

---

##  Ghaziabad
*	June 30, 2019, the plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to the Worlds highest motorable pass called, Khardungla
*	This pass holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	This pass is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude
*	Unpredictable snow and rain, make it worse, specially for two wheeler riders
*	Khardungla holds a unique value in the eyes of all motorcycle riders, like a Makka of Motorcyclists
*	This is my second trip to Laddakh region. Plan left at 3:15 AM from our homes
*	This is one of the hottest days of north Indian summers. By noon we are planning to each Mukerian, Punjab
*	At Karnal i realized that my luggage carrier is broken and hanging from one side
*	My eyes started searching for a welder and soon found a welding shop and get it fixed
*	Somewhere near Phagwara in Punjab, we decided to take lunch at a road side eatery called dhaba
*	Reached Mukerian. Again a small halt at cold drink shop and enjoyed talking with an old man and his son
*	We arrived in Samba and instead of going towards Jammu, decided to take a short cut to Udhampur, J&K
*	Road from Samba to Udhampur is not of good quality, but its scenic and fun to ride in mountains

##  Udhampur
*	Taking minor stops here and there, we are finally arrived at Udhampur at 9:00 PM
*	We are able to find a place for the night, hotel Subhash. After a small bargain and settled in our rooms
*	A small meditation session, helped me to balance my energies after almost 670 kilometers journey of today 
*	As we planned, we left our hotels by 8:00 AM towards Srinagar. Todays journey we will pass through hills, rivers, tunnels and valley
