| This is the story of my motorcycle ride to Khardungla Leh J&K, India|

---

##  Ghaziabad
*	June 30, 2019, the plan is to ride on my 11 years old motorcycle to Worlds highest motorable pass: Khardungla
*	Khardungla holds strategic objective for Indian armed forces, owing to its proximity with China and Pakistan
*	Khardungla is notorious for its difficult terrain, climatic conditions and high altitude
*	Unpredictable snow and rain, make Khardungla worse, specially for two wheeler riders
*	This is my second trip to Laddakh region. As planed, left at 3:15 AM from home
*	This is one of the hottest days of north Indian summers. By noon planning to reach J&K
*	At Karnal i realized that my luggage carrier is broken and hanging from one side
*	My eyes started searching for a welder and soon found a welding shop and get it fixed
*	Somewhere near Phagwara in Punjab, decided to take lunch at a road side eatery called dhaba
*	Reached Mukerian. Again a small halt at cold drink shop and enjoyed talking with an old man and his son
*	Arrived in Samba and instead of going towards Jammu, decided to take a short cut to Udhampur, J&K
*	Road from Samba to Udhampur is not of good condition, but its scenic and fun to ride through mountains

##  Udhampur
*	Taking minor stops here and there, finally arrived at Udhampur around 9:00 PM
*	Able to find a place for the night, hotel Subhash. After a small bargain, settled in room
*	A small meditation session, helped me to balance my energies after almost 670 kilometers journey of today 
*	Next morning, heading towards Srinagar, passing through bridges, tunnels and valley on NH 44
*	After almost 30 minutes ride, arrived at [Chenani Nashri Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenani-Nashri_Tunnel)
*	Scrounged delicious apricots, famous in this region. Apricots fulfilled my glucose need for the entire day

##  Banihal
*	A small hill town, Indian railways has recently marked its presence in this town
*	This is auspicious season of Ramadan and mosques are playing soothing prayer on loudspeakers
*	Next week is going to be Eid al-Fitr, the holy festival of Muslims
*	After few minor stops, arrived at [Jawahar Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawahar_Tunnel), which is operational since 1956
*	Post this tunnel, starts the beautiful Srinagar valley. Titanic point gives you the first glance of it
*	Took a noodle (Maggi) stop here, captured some scenic moments of heaven on earth
*	Talked to some of the south Indian riders, who were riding from Kottayam  
*	Only few kilometers from Titanic point, arrived at the famous NH 44. Which is a nice road
*	Ride on NH 44 is smooth. I cherished every moment while riding through the beautiful valley
*	Took several stops, while passing adjacent to several towns like Tral, Anantnag and Pulwama etc
*	Armed forces are everywhere on NH 44, constantly reminding the sensitivity of this zone
*	My motorcycle has started giving my hiccups and i need to keep cleaning my spark plugs after every 30 mins of ride
*	Either a adulterated fuel or any carburetor related issue is affecting my speed

##  Srinagar
*	For almost 3 hours ride through NH 44, arrived at the heart of Srinagar, the famous Dal Lake
*	Weather is cool here, tourists are flocked around the lake. We took a minor pause
*	A curious kid is attracted towards us. Entire family of the kid, gets involved in interaction with us
*	Before saying good bye to us, this family suggested us to visit a nearby temple named Kshir Bhawani
*	I am not able to find any mechanic here, owing to Ramadan days, all mechanics are retired early for the day
*	Decided to find a mechanic tomorrow early, we started riding for another 20 kilometers towards Ganderbal
*	Entire Srinagar is busy, lots of life around mosques and roads crossings. We are getting good feelings
*	We stopped here and there to talk to local people and received warm reception by everyone
*	Armed forces everywhere, which is making us never forget that we are in disturbed region of our country

##  Ganderbal
*	After riding for almost 30 kilometers through beautiful roads, we entered in Ganderbal
*	A left turn towards Kshir Bhawani and another 8 kilometers ride, we reached the temple premises
*	A temple with a entire company of security forces for security with so much of preparation, made me feel strange  
*	Entire temple campus is secured with barbed wire and its gate is secured with barricade and fish nets etc
*	We are able to get permission, the security people are able to recognize from my dialect that i belong to central India
*	Temple has a guest house, run by J&K government tourism department, at a small charges of only 500 rupees
